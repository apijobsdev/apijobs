> The overriding design goal for Markdown's formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it's been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.

This text you see here is *actually* written in Markdown! To get a feel for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and watch the results in the right.

## How it works

APIJobs accesses data from over 4000 job boards to ensure comprehensive and up-to-date job listings. Our API parses through a variety of sources to fetch the most relevant job opportunities in real-time, allowing your application to provide the freshest data to your users.

## How to integrate it

### CURL
```bash
curl --location 'https://api.apijobs.dev/v1/job/search' \
  --header 'apikey: myapikey' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "q" : "Reactjs"
  }'

### Python
```python
import requests

url = "https://api.apijobs.dev/v1/job/search"
headers = {
    'apikey': 'myapikey',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}
payload = {
    'q': 'Python Developer'
}

response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
print(response.text)
```

### Javascript
```javascript
const url = 'https://api.apijobs.dev/v1/job/search';
const data = {
    q: 'Data Scientist'
};

fetch(url, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'apikey': 'myapikey',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(data)
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log(data))
.catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
```

### Java
```java
import java.net.HttpURLConnection;
import java.net.URL;
import java.io.OutputStream;
import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;

public class APIJobs {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            URL url = new URL("https://api.apijobs.dev/v1/job/search");
            HttpURLConnection conn = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
            conn.setRequestMethod("POST");
            conn.setRequestProperty("Content-Type", "application/json");
            conn.setRequestProperty("apikey", "myapikey");
            conn.setDoOutput(true);
            
            String data = "{ \"q\": \"Java Developer\" }";
            OutputStream os = conn.getOutputStream();
            os.write(data.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
            os.close();

            // Handle response here...

        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
